# X-Plane-Map by @foucdeg

## How it Works

X-Plane can be configured to send out aircraft location data over the network.
This application listens to those network exchanges and displays your aircraft on a Google Map.

## Need help ?

If you cannot get the map to work, email me at foucauld.degeorges@gmail.com.

For any bug reports or feature requests/ideas, leave an [issue on Github](https://github.com/foucdeg/x-plane-map-electron/issues).
